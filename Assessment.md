## She Code Africa Cloud School - Technical Assesment
The She Code Africa cloud School (in partnership with Deimos Cloud) is a 3months cohort-style, bootcamp program specifically targeted at ladies across Africa, looking to kick off or switch careers into the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) field. Accepted participants are paired with Cloud experts and work with a well curated learning path inclusive of tasks, projects etc to help them grow required practical skills in the field. Upon Graduation, top 4 participants are offered Intern positions and next top 2 granted full nanodegree Cloud Engineering scholarships via Udacity.

The technical assessments below provides us an idea of the learning efforts you have put in towards your learning journey for the field. Feel free to use search engines and online resources - Do not aim for perfect but a working solution.

TO GET STARTED, PICK ANY OF THE FOLLOWING EXERCISES OF YOUR CHOICE (PS: We value candidates who go the extra mile in selecting and solving Exercise 2). Good luck!

## EXERCISE 1:
- Create  a cloud account with a free tier subscription (AWS or AZURE).
 - Create an instance (either  a linux  or windows OS )	
 - Download and install Jenkins on your local machine to run on the default port 8080
 - Create a repository on Github called ``SCA Cloud School Application``
 - Write any simple code, in your  language of choice (c#, java,  python) on your local machine and push it to github .
 - Integrate  your github repo to your Jenkins 
 - Setup a  build job on Jenkins 
 - On submission , share the url to access your jenkin  server also advice   the   username and  password  for login (this can be different  from  your own account and you can also delete the account after the assessment )

## EXERCISE 2:
- Install docker on your machine 
- Create a docker hub account
- Create a Github repository called `SCA Cloud School Application`
- Create a Dockerfile which displays a webpage (in your preffered language ) and a text: ``Welcome to SCA Cloud School Application``
- Once done, run the container and test the application. Kindly Describe your test process and provide output
- Create a branch named ``Start`` and a folder named ``docker``
- Commit your Dockerfile and other files used in the ``docker`` folder
- Update the Dockerfile so the webpage displays ``Welcome to SCA Cloud School Application , this is my first assessment``
- Commit these changes to the repo into a branch called ``feature``and Merge your ``feature branch`` to the ``start branch`` ( _do not delete the feature branch_)
- Push your final docker image to dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/)
- Your github repo ``Master`` branch should only have a readme file with instructions/documentaion used for your deployment and a link to your docker hub repository


## SUBMISSION:
- Explain briefly  the Jenkins pipeline syntax used for defining JenkinsFile on your .mdfile on Github. Key steps we would like to see are Source(git) ----Build/package --Deploy. 
- Push your project to your github repo created (and dockerhub if applicable).
- submit your project github URL on the application form here: [www.shecodeafrica.org/events]

*Good luck!*
